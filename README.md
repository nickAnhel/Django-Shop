First of all you need to create python virtual environment. You can do this by running
the following command in your terminal.

```console
python -m venv "your-venv-name"
```

Next you need to install all third-party modules.

```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

docker pull rabbitmq
docker run -it --rm --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:management
